* [dcat:Catalogue](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#Catalogue) properties dcat:dataset, dcat:record, dcat:service can occur 0-* times, but in sum should occur at least once (catalogue should not be empty)
* [dcat:DataService](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#DataService) property dcat:endpointDescription usage note (see https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#Property:data_service_endpoint_description): An endpoint description may be expressed in a machine-readable form, such as an OpenAPI (Swagger) description [OpenAPI], an OGC GetCapabilities response [WFS], [ISO-19142], [WMS], [ISO-19128], a SPARQL Service Description [SPARQL11-SERVICE-DESCRIPTION], an [OpenSearch] or [WSDL20] document, a Hydra API description [HYDRA], else in text or some other informal mode if a formal representation is not possible.
* [dcat:DataService](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#DataService) property dcat:endpointURL usage note: The endpoint URL SHOULD be persistent.
* [dcat:DataService](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#DataService) property dcatap:hvdCategory section controlled vocabularies to be used: a number of properties are listed with controlled vocabularies that MUST be used for the listed properties. The declaration of the following controlled vocabularies as mandatory ensures a minimum level of interoperability. https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/high-value-dataset-category, 
http://data.europa.eu/bna/asd487ae75
* [dcat:Dataset](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#Dataset) property dcat:conformsTo usage note: This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema, ontology, view or profile that this representation of a dataset conforms to. This is (generally) a complementary concern to the media-type or format. The provided information should enable to the verification whether the detailed information requirements by the HVD is satisfied. For more usage suggestions see section on specific data requirements (https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#c7).

* [dcat:Distribution](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#Distribution) property dcat:accessURL usage note: dcat:accessURL SHOULD be used for the URL of a service or location that can provide access to this distribution, typically through a Web form, query or API call. dcat:downloadURL is preferred for direct links to downloadable resources. If the distribution(s) are accessible only through a landing page (i.e., direct download URLs are not known), then the landing page URL associated with the dcat:Dataset SHOULD be duplicated as access URL on a distribution (see 5.7 Dataset available only behind some Web page).
* [dcat:Distribution](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#Distribution) property dcat:license usage note: Information about licenses and rights SHOULD be provided on the level of Distribution. Information about licenses and rights MAY be provided for a Dataset in addition to but not instead of the information provided for the Distributions of that Dataset. Providing license or rights information for a Dataset that is different from information provided for a Distribution of that Dataset SHOULD be avoided as this can create legal conflicts. See also guidance at 9. License and rights statements.
* [dcat:Distribution](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#Distribution) property dcat:rights usage note: dcterms:license, which is a sub-property of dcterms:rights, can be used to link a distribution to a license document. However, dcterms:rights allows linking to a rights statement that can include licensing information as well as other information that supplements the license such as attribution.
* [dcat:Distribution](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/2.2.0-hvd/#Distribution) property dcat:conformsTo usage note: This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema, ontology, view or profile that this representation of a dataset conforms to.
